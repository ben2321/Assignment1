<h3 style="color: #e45826;">Education to date:</h3>
<p style="color: white;">I spent the first 8 years of my education at Stella Maris Catholic Primary School, Burnie Tasmania. I then spent the next 6 years at the sister school, Marist Regional College where I did grade 7 to grade 12. I graduated grade 12 last year and I am now commencing my first year in a 3-year bachelor’s degree in Information Technology. </p>
 
 <h3 style="color: #e45826;">Language Spoken:</h3>
 <p style="color: white;">I have only spoken English all my life, although I did study French and Japanese for a year each in grade 8 as they were mandatory electives, although saying that I currently remember none of either.</p>
 
 <h3 style="color: #e45826;">Hobby:</h3>
 <p style="color: white;">A hobby that I have that I find most interesting would be my interest in PC hardware and assembly. I enjoy looking into current PC companies and their new hardware, like Ryzen and Intel CPU developers and Razer/ Corsair with their gaming peripherals. My interest in PC hardware and assembly began in 2018, when I began to save my money from part time work to buy and assemble my own desktop PC in February of 2019.</p>
 
 <h3 style="color: #e45826;">Favourite Sport:</h3>
 <p style="color: white;">My favorite sport is football (AFL), I have been playing and following since I was 5. My favorite team is the ‘Tassie Hawks', my Father signed me up for a membership to the club when he found out my Mother was pregnant with me.</p>
 
 <h3 style="color: #e45826;">Pets:</h3>
 <p style="color: white;">I have a British Blue shorthaired cat named Calvin, he is turning 3 in July this year. My family back home also got a new German Shepherd puppy named Remi this week who I get to meet when I go home next.</p>
 
 <h3 style="color: #e45826;">Pastime:</h3>
 <p style="color: white; margin-bottom: 75px;">My favorite past time is gaming, I enjoy playing most types of games, but my favorite now are first-person shooters (FPS). I like playing Tom Clancy’s Rainbow six siege, my friends and I have been playing for nearly 6 years now. I have been playing video games since I was quite young, I began on the original Xbox where I then moved to the PlayStation 2. From those two consoles I went to the Xbox 360, I then got both the Xbox one and the PlayStation 4. When I built my PC, I also began to game on it, but mostly single player games.</p>
 
 <h1 style="color: #e45826;">Interest in IT</h1>
 <p style="color: white; margin-bottom: 75px;">My interest in IT began when I began gaming when I was about 8 years old, gaming made me slowly more experienced and comfortable with IT systems and technology. As I have gone through life, I have used many different types of technology which spawned a sort of passion to work with technology, so IT was the best option for me. 
 There was not a specific moment or person that sparked my interests in IT, it was just the collection of experiences with technology through my life that has led to IT and technology being my main interest in life. 
 Through my life I have used many different consoles and pieces of technology, this meant I used different operating systems and experienced different errors and problems. I want to learn more about IT so that I can not only have a possible career in my interested field but learning more about IT can also assist me with different errors I could potentially run into in future.</p>
 
 <h1 style="color: #e45826; text-align: center">Ideal Job</h1>
 <p style="color: white;">My ideal job would be working in the gaming industry but mostly towards testing games and gaming devices. Testing games and gaming devices would require me to play new prototypes of games or devices and evaluate what is good about them and what needs to be fixed. This job is most appealing to me since I have had a passion for gaming since I was very young, I love to both learn about the capabilities of the devices and play all new aspects of games and see how they both evolve with time.
  I would need to be able to work with a team, I will also need basic gaming skills to be able to properly test both a game and a gaming console. I would also need the skills to be able to evaluate and express the problems and bugs that I find, along with possible fixes.
  I believe that I can work well in a team as I have been in social situations most my life and have worked in team-based situations in my part time work at McDonald’s. I believe I also have beyond basic knowledge of how to play games and how they should be played as I have been playing games consistently for many years, I also believe I could have good ideas for mechanics and storylines as I have had various experiences with plenty of different games from online shooters games to story-based adventures.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #e45826; text-align: center">Myers-Briggs test:</h3>
  <img src="myers_briggs_test.PNG" alt="Myers Briggs Test" width="750px" style="margin-left: 250px">
  <p style="color: white; margin-bottom: 75px;">Having a 52% score of extraverted shows that I can be at times social and outgoing, I can have the confidence to approach new people and experience new things. My energy is nearly down the middle, but I am mostly observant, this means I like to pay attention to details in life. My nature is primarily based on feeling, meaning I can understand other emotions and I am less competitive then thinking types. My tactics trait is judging, this means I am thorough and decisive it also means I prefer structure and predictability over spontaneity. My identity is mostly turbulent, this means that my personality is mostly prone to stress and I am success driven with perfectionist traits and I am eager to prove.
  I believe that my mainly extraverted result will help when meeting and working with the new people in my group, having a feeling nature I can understand how others are feeling allowing for a smoother group. My tactics and identity traits suggest I will be able to keep the groups work on track and inevitably finished. 
  I will need to attempt to find other workmates that are somewhat like my traits when it comes to getting work done. My mind and nature traits should make it easier to fit into most groups.</p>
 
  <h3 style="color: #e45826; text-align: center">Learning Style Test:</h3>
  <img src="learning_test.PNG" alt="Learning test" width="750px" style="margin-left: 250px">
  <p style="color: white;  margin-bottom: 75px;">These results show that I am most likely to learn in most situations and styles, but my main is tactile which is described to be ‘doing’. This means to be able to learn in full capability I will need to physically practice the things that I learn.
  The results will influence my teamwork in the way that I will be more successful with my work if I am completing tasks, opposed to simply researching and attempting to retain said information. I believe that from the results I would be able to complete most tasks assigned/ taken as I am overall all round when it comes to learning styles.
  When assigning tasks in the team I should attempt to take on the task that I have worked most on as I will then be able to complete most effectively. If I cannot find a task that I have worked most on that will still be fine as the results show that I can still learn well in other styles.</p>
  
  <h3 style="color: #e45826; text-align: center;">Big 5 Test:</h3>
  <img src="big5.PNG" alt="Big 5 test" width="750px" style="margin-left: 250px;">
  <p style="color: white; margin-bottom: 75px;">These scores show that I am a little above the middle score for each trait except agreeableness. This means I am slightly outgoing from the extroversion result; I am emotionally stable, I have a high agreeableness meaning I am friendly and optimistic, I am careful and diligent from the consciousness result and I am in the middle of traditional thinking and imaginative.
  I believe the results will make working in a team somewhat easy, as I will be able to work with the team mates well due to my extroversion and agreeableness results.
  The results show that it should be quite simply picking a group as I should be able to make contacts/ friends easily and hopefully quickly.</p>
  
  <h1 style="color: #e45826;">Project Idea</h1>
  <h2 style="color: #e45826;">Overview:</h2>
  <p style="color: white;">The idea for a project could be to create a To-Do application where the user can create list of things to do for their day/ week/ month and possibly year, the user could also use the app for recipes and shopping lists. The lists can be saved through the apps system along with the function to create new lists. The To-Do list app would be able to send notifications to the user when the end date for the list is close.</p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #e45826;">Description:</h2>
  <p style="color: white;">The reason why the To-Do list would be a useful app to have is because it will help users keep track of all the things that are needed to be done through the notification system, but it will also help with the smaller less important things needed to be done. This would be a helpful thing for people who lead very busy lives to keep track of all the things they need to do, and it can help for cooking by storing recipes. The idea would be interesting in the way that it could be created, experimenting with different features and including being able to edit the To-Do list to make it look good with different fonts, colours of the font and background etc. In the modern world there are so many things that are needed to be remembered in a day-to-day life so the To-Do list app with inbuilt notifications would be very helpful.
  The app will begin with a blank main screen where in the top right corner will have an addition symbol (+) where you can add your first To-Do list, the To-Do list creation would start with dot points where the user would write what they need to do, if the list is one thing then the submit button would be on the bottom of the screen and this would save the list and take you back to the main screen and your To-Do list would be there. If the list was longer than one step, then the user would write the first step and then press enter which will drop to the next step with a new dot point. To edit the To-Do list the user would need to go into a saved list and press the options button at the top right which would be represented with three dots stacked on each other, in this edit tab would be where the user can edit the fonts, the colours of the text and background and the notification/ alarm function for reminding the user about the To-Do list.</p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #e45826;">Tools/Tech:</h2>
  <p style="color: white;">I would not exactly know the exact hardware or software needed to create the app, but I know that there would need to be code written so that the actions can be completed properly by the user, there will also be a need for somewhat modern computer hardware for the processing and graphical editing.</p>
  
  <h2 style="color: #e45826;">Skills Required:</h2>
  <p style="color: white;">The skills needed would not be hard to find/ learn, there would be many articles and tutorials on how to create a simple To-Do list but the more advanced parts of the To-Do list like the notification function would be rather difficult to a person who is just beggining in app development. The prototype used to test the layout could be created by using websites like proto.io or anyother website or software that allows you to create a prototype app.</p>
  <a href="https://proto.io/" style="color: #e36bae; font-size: 25px"> proto.io</a>
  <h2 style="color: #e45826;">Outcome:</h2>
  <p style="color: white;">The final successful project would be an app that allows the user to create To-Do lists and edit them with ease. The final product would also be able to send notifications to the user to remind them about the To-Do lists that they created.
  The original problem was that it is difficult to remember everything that needs to be done in life especially with a busy schedule, the project would successfully be able to remind users with their To-Do lists as everyone in modern society always has access to smartphones which means constant reminding to the user.
  The success of the project would result in users being able to complete the tasks that they would otherwise forget or store information that they would otherwise forget.</p>
